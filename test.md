- what the meaning of **median** measurement?
the median is a measure of central tendency that is fairly unaffected by unusually high or low values relative to the rest of the data.

- how to calc **median**?
1. order number for least to greatest.
1. odd? -> middle; even -> avg of two middle numbers

- what the meaning of **mode**?
The **mode** of a list of numbers is the number that occurs most frequently in the list.

e.g., the list 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7, 10, 10, 10, 20 has two modes, 3 and 10.

- **range** can reflect the {{maximum spread}} of the data?

- Measures of **dispersion** indicate the {{degree of “spread”}} of the data.

given the list 11, 10, 5, 13, 21, the range of the numbers is.

- what's the meaning of **standard deviation**?

the standard deviation is a measure of spread that depends on each number in the list.

- the more the data are spread away from the mean, the {{greater}} the standard deviation; and vice versa;

- *In any group of data*, most of the data are within about {{3}} standard deviations above or below the mean.

- A set that has no members is called the empty set and is denoted by the symbol {{\\(\\emptyset\)}}.

- diff between *set* and *list*?
1. in list, members are **ordered**
2. elements can be repeated in a list and the repetitions matter.

- For any finite set *S*, the number of elements of *S* is denoted by {{*|S|*}}

\\(S = \\{ 6.2, - 9, \pi, 0.01, 0 \\}\\) -> \\(|S| = 5\\)

- give the expression of permutations of *n* objects taken *k* at a time

\\[ \frac{n!}{(n - k)!} \\]
