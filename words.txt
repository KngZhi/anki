This may or may not be an acceptable #workaround
larger apps became #marooned on previous versions as soon as the first major version change
“However programming is a #design discipline, in a very special way.”

“At the same time, many people feel #ambivalent about their own memory.”
“While Anki is an extremely simple program, it's possible to develop #virtuoso skill using Anki,”
That is, Anki makes memory a choice, rather than a #haphazard event, to be left to chance”
My somewhat #pious belief was that if people focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less about the “difficult” high-level issue…
This has been the clearest and most #colloquial introductory explanation of ML ever, + with super fun
As a concept, ARGV is a #convention in programming that goes back (at least) to the C language
Node.js #couples JavaScript with an event loop for quickly dispatching opera- tions when events occur
We’ll use supporting code throughout the book to make our programs more robust, more #scalable, and more manageable.
it deserves #scrutiny since it takes advantage of a number of JavaScript and Node.js features
[Aside from] having a #terser syntax than older function expressions, arrow functions have another big advantage over their ancestral counterparts
#Shuttling data in this way can be a slow operation
If your program could #conceivably continue about its business, then it’s better to take the safe route and stick to asynchronous I/O.
However, by nature they’re #confined to the machine
If you want to have some #leeway but still be a little more strict
In computer networks, a reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources [on behalf of] a client from one or more servers.
This is [by far] the preferred way to do I/O in Node.
However, [by nature] they’re confined to the machine
This test will pass [irrespective of] which of these methods you use to delay the second chunk
But many of the choices needed in the design of such a system must be made in an [ad hoc] way
